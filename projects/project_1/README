    btc_price_data_mod_2.csv
    btc_price_data_mod_3.csv

  when prompted, enter the file name and press enter.
  then when prompted enter the count of lines in the file

  for the chunked files provided you can enter 10
  if you want to run the whole dataset you can enter 30

  if you want to create your own dataset, the format in the datafiles is:
  "index,openPrice,closePrice,20-day-moving-average,99-day-moving-average"

  EX 1:
  $ java -cp jess/Jess61p4/jess.jar jess.Main btc-trader.jess  
  filename? btc_price_data_mod_1.csv (return)
  datapoint in file? 10 (return)
  
  [Program output is displayed]

  EX 2:
  $ java -cp jess/Jess61p4/jess.jar jess.Main btc-trader.jess  
  filename? btc_price_data_mod_2.csv (return)
  datapoint in file? 10 (return)
  
  [Program output is displayed]

  EX 3:
  $ java -cp jess/Jess61p4/jess.jar jess.Main btc-trader.jess  
  filename? btc_price_data_mod_3.csv (return)
  datapoint in file? 10 (return)
  
  [Program output is displayed]

  EX 4 (run all data at once):
  $ java -cp jess/Jess61p4/jess.jar jess.Main btc-trader.jess  
  filename? btc_price_data_mod.csv (return)
